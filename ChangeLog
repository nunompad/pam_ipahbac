	* It now works with Solaris 11.3 Needed a few changes but it works. It's
	untested against other Solaris versions and I won't bother doing it. If
	someone needs needs to, please test and report :)

	* It's aliiive! It works on GNU/Linux (Fedora 23) for a custom command. Should
	work on Solaris with OpenLDAP, but it's completely untested so far.
